# Spine test library

This module stores utilities for testing the Spine framework.

The utilities include common base classes for tests like 
[utility class test](src/main/java/io/spine/testing/UtilityClassTest.java), custom 
[assert statements](src/main/java/io/spine/testing/Verify.java), common test 
[display names](src/main/java/io/spine/testing/DisplayNames.java) and others.

Most testing utilities rely on [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) API for their work.
