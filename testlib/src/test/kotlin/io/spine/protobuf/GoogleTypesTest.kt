         Starting from v3.22.0 Google Protobuf for Java (`protobuf-java-3.22.0.jar`) no longer
         contains the `plugin.proto`. The file is still present in the Protobuf source code tree
         under `protobuf/src/google/protobuf/compiler/` directory, but it does not seem to
         present in artifacts produced for Java.

         The references to `plugin.proto` are present in build files for C++. So, it could be an
         omission in the v3.22 build, or Protobuf authors may see that this rarely used proto file
         can be included in the source code tree for code generators written in other languages.
         We still want the latest version of the Protobuf library and the `protoc` compiler.
         So, using `plugin.proto` as a source file copy under `tool-base` is a backup option for us.

         Please uncomment the below line if the file appears back in the Protobuf distribution
         archive for Java.
