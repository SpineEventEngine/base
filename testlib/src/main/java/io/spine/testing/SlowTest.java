 * suite.

 * <p>Slow tests typically are functional test, which may call network API, perform I/O operations,
 * spawn many threads and wait for execution, etc.
 *
 * <p>This annotation is an alias for {@code Tag("slow")}. Adding the {@code slow} tag on a test
 * case produces the same effect as adding this annotation.
