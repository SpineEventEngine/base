/**
 * A parser for files in one of the supported [formats][io.spine.format.Format].
 *
 * ### API Note
 *
 * This interface is used internally for parsing any types from [ByteSource].
 * It should not be confused with [com.google.protobuf.Parser] which is used
 * in the Protobuf generated code for parsing [com.google.protobuf.Message] types
 * from various binary format inputs.
 *
 * @param T The type of the upper bound served by the parser.
 *   For example, if a parser supports parsing Protobuf message types,
 *   the argument would be [com.google.protobuf.Message].
