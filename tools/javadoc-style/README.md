# Spine Javadoc Prettifier

The Gradle which re-formats Javadoc parts of the Java code generated from Proto types defined
in a module.

The plugin performs the following formatting:

1. Removes `<pre>` tags generated by the Protobuf compiler.
2. Replaces a text in backticks by the text in `{@code }` tag.

## Usage

The plugin may be used as follows:

```groovy
apply plugin: "io.spine.javadoc-style"
```

The configuration example:

```groovy
protoJavadoc {
     mainGenProtoDir = "directory_with_main_sources"
     testGenProtoDir = "directory_with_test_sources"
 }
 ```
 
 Directories are specified relative to the project root and should contain files generated from 
 the `.proto` definitions. If directories contain other files, they will be formatted too.
