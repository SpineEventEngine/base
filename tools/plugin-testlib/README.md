# Spine plugin test library

This module contains utilities for testing Spine Gradle plugins.

The Spine Gradle plugins are covered by the integration tests that require programmatic Gradle 
project setup and are run in the separate process.

This module brings helper functionality to work with the
[Gradle API](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/) for the integration tests setup.

See the [smoke tests](../../tests) module.
