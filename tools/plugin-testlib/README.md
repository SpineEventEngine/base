# Spine plugin testlib

This module contains utilities for testing Spine Gradle plugins.

Spine Gradle plugins are covered by the integration tests which require separate Gradle project 
setup and are run in separate Gradle process.

This module brings helper functionality to work with Gradle API and setup environment for 
integration tests.
