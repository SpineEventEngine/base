# Spine plugin testlib

This module contains utilities for testing Spine Gradle plugins.

The Spine Gradle plugins are covered by the integration tests which require separate Gradle project 
setup and are run in the separate Gradle process.

This module brings helper functionality to work with the
[Gradle API](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/) and to setup environment for the integration 
tests.

See [smoke tests](../smoke-tests) module.
