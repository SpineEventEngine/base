# Spine Javadoc Prettifier

The Gradle plugin which assists in Javadoc formatting across files generated from the Protobuf 
definitions.

The plugin does the following formatting:

1. Removes `<pre>` tags generated by the Protobuf compiler.
2. Replaces text in backticks by the text in the `{@code}` tag.

## Usage

The plugin may be used as follows:

```groovy
apply plugin: "io.spine.tools.protobuf-javadoc-plugin"
```

The configuration example:

```groovy
protoJavadoc {
     mainGenProtoDir = "directory_with_main_sources"
     testGenProtoDir = "directory_with_test_sources"
 }
 ```
 
 Directories are specified relative to the project root and should contain files generated from 
 `.proto` definitions. If they contain other files, they will be formatted too.
