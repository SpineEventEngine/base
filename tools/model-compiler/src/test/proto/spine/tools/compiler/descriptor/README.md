`FileDescriptorSuperset` tests

This Protobuf package defines sources for testing descriptor merging plugin and 
`FileDescriptorSuperset` in particular.

The sources themselves are used only in assertions.
The compiled descriptor set files (`known_types.desc`) for these files belong to the project test
resources (see `src/test/resources/descriptors`).
