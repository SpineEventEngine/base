# ðŸ§­ LLM goals

These goals guide how agents (ChatGPT, Codex) are used in this project to:
- Help developers move faster without sacrificing code quality.
- Provide language-aware guidance on Kotlin/Java idioms.
- Lower the barrier to onboarding new contributors.
- Enable collaborative, explainable, and auditable development with AI.

## Problem-solving framework for complex tasks

When faced with complex tasks, follow this framework:

1. **Decompose**: Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
2. **Analyze**: Understand the architectural implications of each part.
3. **Pattern-Match**: Identify established patterns that apply.
4. **Implement**: Write code that follows project conventions.
5. **Test**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage.
6. **Document**: Provide clear explanations of your solution.

*This framework helps maintain consistency across contributions from different agents.*
