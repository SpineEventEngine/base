# Project Configuration for Claude Code

## Agent Guidelines
Please read and follow all guidelines in the project's agent documentation:

- Start with the table of contents: `./agents/_TOC.md`.
- Follow all linked documents from the TOC.
- Apply all coding standards, formatting rules, and project conventions found in these documents.

## Key Points for Claude Code
- All guidelines in the `.agents` directory apply to Claude Code interactions.
- Pay special attention to Kotlin formatting requirements (trailing newlines, detekt compliance).
- Follow project-specific conventions documented in the agent guidelines.

## Priority
The `.agents` directory contains the authoritative project standards.
These take precedence over default behaviors.
