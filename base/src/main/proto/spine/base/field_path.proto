// Field path is a set of message field names.
// For example, consider the following message declarations:
//
//     message CustomerAccount {
//       User user = 1;
//     }
//
//     message User {
//       string name = 1;
//     }
//
// The field path for `name` field of the User message is ["user", "name"] set.
//
// So, the first entry in the names set is a name of a field in some root message,
// the next one is a field found in the first one, and so on.
