// Field path provides field names of nested messages.

// The first entry in the names list is a name of a field in the root message.
// The second entry is the name of the field in the nested message, and so on.
//
// For example, consider the following message declarations:
//
//     message CustomerAccount {
//       User user = 1;
//     }
//
//     message User {
//       string name = 1;
//     }
//
// The field path for `name` field of the `User` message enclosed into the `CustomerAccount`
// is ["user", "name"].
