/**
 * A common interface for entity state messages.
 *
 * Any message that defines an `(entity)` option with a valid `kind` is an entity state.
 *
 * The `kind` of the entity state defines the actual interface of the entity state
 * which could be this interface or one extends it.
 * If the `kind` is [ENTITY][io.spine.option.EntityOption.Kind.ENTITY] the generated
 * message will implement this interface. Otherwise, it would be one of the subinterfaces.
 * For example, if the `kind` is [PROJECTION][io.spine.option.EntityOption.Kind.PROJECTION],
 * the generated message will implement [ProjectionState].
 *
 * The field of the entity state message, which is declared first in the code of
 * the message, is treated as its identifier. This convention that has two goals:
 *
 *  1. The definition of an entity state always starts with its ID with no
 *   extra Protobuf options.
 *
 *  2. Developers don't forget to specify which of the fields declared in Protobuf
 *   corresponds to the entity ID.
 *
 * During code generation, the CoreJvm Compiler substitutes the generic parameter
 * [I] with an actual type of the first field of the entity state message.
 *
 * @param I The type of entity identifiers.
 *   It could be one of the types described in the [IdType] enum.
