/**
 * A common interface for entity state messages.
 *
 * Any message that defines an `(entity)` option with a valid `kind` is an entity state.
 *
 * The `kind` of the entity state defines the actual interface of the entity state
 * which could be this interface or one extends it.
 * If the `kind` is [ENTITY][io.spine.option.EntityOption.Kind.ENTITY] the generated
 * message will implement this interface. Otherwise, it would be one of the subinterfaces.
 * For example, if the `kind` is [PROJECTION][io.spine.option.EntityOption.Kind.PROJECTION],
 * the generated message will implement [ProjectionState].
 *
 * The field of the entity state message, which is declared first in the code of
 * the message, is treated as its identifier. The "first" field is determined by the order
 * in which fields appear in the Protobuf message definition (reading order from top to bottom),
 * not by the field number. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * message UserView {
 *     option (entity).kind = PROJECTION;
 *
 *     UserName name = 2;  // This is the ID field (first in reading order)
 *     UserId id = 1;       // Not the ID field (second in reading order)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This convention has two goals:
 *
 *  1. The definition of an entity state always starts with its ID with no
 *   extra Protobuf options.
 *
 *  2. Developers don't forget to specify which of the fields declared in Protobuf
 *   corresponds to the entity ID.
 *
 * The reading order approach also provides benefits:
 *
 *  - Easier to read and understand — developers see the ID field immediately.
 *  - Supports field deprecation scenarios — if an ID field needs to be replaced
 *    (e.g., upgrading from `int32` to `int64`), the new field can be added at the top
 *    while the old field is deprecated in place.
 *
 * During code generation, the CoreJvm Compiler substitutes the generic parameter
 * [I] with an actual type of the first field of the entity state message.
 *
 * @param I The type of entity identifiers.
 *   It could be one of the types described in the [IdType] enum.
