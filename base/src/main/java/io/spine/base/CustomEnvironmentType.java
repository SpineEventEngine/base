 * with those registered by the framework user:

 * public final class Application {
 *
 *     static {
 *         Environment.instance()
 *                    .register(Staging.class)
 *                    .register(LoadTesting().class);
 *     }
 *
 *     private final ConnectionPool pool;
 *
 *     private Application() {
 *         Environment environment = Environment.instance();
 *         if (environment.is(Tests.class) {
 *              // Single connection is enough for tests.
 *             this.pool = new ConnectionPoolImpl(PoolCapacity.of(1));
 *         } else {
 *             if(environment.is(LoadTesting.class) {
 *                 this.pool =
 *                         new ConnectionPoolImpl(PoolCapacity.fromConfig("load_tests.yml"));
 *             } else {
 *                 this.pool =
 *                         new ConnectionPoolImpl(PoolCapacity.fromConfig("cloud_deployment.yml"));
 *             }
 *         }
 *         //...
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>When registering custom types, please ensure</b> their mutual exclusivity.
 * If two or more environment types {@linkplain EnvironmentType#enabled() consider themselves
 * enabled} at the same time, the behaviour of {@link Environment#is(Class)} is undefined.
