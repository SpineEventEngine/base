     * <p>Due to the limitations of the most storage engines, which round the time values to
     * the nearest or the lowest microsecond, the nanosecond values produced by
     * this class are incremented by {@code 1 000} nanoseconds, i.e. by {@code 1} microsecond

     * It is designed to keep the millisecond value provided by a typical-JVM system clock intact.
     *
     * <p>The nanosecond value is reset for each new passed {@code seconds} and {@code nanos} values.
     * That allows to receive {@code 1 000} distinct time values per millisecond.
     *
     * <p>In case the upper bound of the nanos is reached, meaning that there were more than
     * {@code 1 000} calls to this class within a millisecond, the nanosecond value is reset
     * back to {@code 0}.
