/**
 * A common interface for entity state messages.
 *
 * <p>Any message that defines an {@code (entity)} option with a valid {@code kind} is marked with
 * this interface by the Model Compiler.
 *
 * <p>The first field of the entity state message is treated as its identifier. It is a convention
 * that has two goals:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The definition of an entity state always starts with its ID with no extra Protobuf
 *     options. This way it's feels easy and more natural to read the code.

 *     <li>Developers don't forget to specify which of the fields declared in Protobuf corresponds
 *     to the entity ID.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>At codegen-time, the Model Compiler substitutes the generic parameter {@code <I>} with
 * an actual type of the first field of the entity state message.
 *
 * @param <I>
 *         the type of entity identifiers
 * @see io.spine.code.proto.EntityStateOption
