/**
 * Indicates an interface which is used for extending generated code using default methods
 * declared in the interface.
 *
 * <p>In order to generate a class which implements a custom interface:
 * <ol>
 *    <li>Create the interface and mark it with this annotation.
 *    <li>Declare methods of interest following the Protobuf convention for the accessor methods.
 *    For example, if a message has a property named {@code foo_bar}, the method to declare will
 *    be {@code getFooBar()}.
 *    <li>Add {@code default} methods. Presumably bodies of these methods will call accessor
 *    methods declared earlier.
 *    <li>Mark corresponding proto messages using the {@code (is).java_type} option (if for
 *    one message), or {@code (every_is).java_type} option for a file, if the interface is common
 *    for all the message declared in this file. These options instruct Spine Model Compiler to
 *    make the generated code implement this interface.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The annotation should <em>NOT</em> be used on interfaces that do not provide default methods,
 * as implementing classes would not be mixins.
