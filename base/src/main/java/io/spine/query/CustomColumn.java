 * A column storing the data which is not directly declared as a field in the {@code Message}

 *
 * <p>End-users may choose to store some arbitrary or computed on-the-fly data
 * along with the record. E.g. the time of entity creation or the role of the user created
 * the record etc. That is, something which isn't included into the definition
 * of the {@code Message} type of the record.
 *
 * <p>The framework users would need to provide their own {@link CustomColumn} implementation.
 * When storing objects with custom columns, the values are fetched according
 * to the {@link #valueIn(Object) valueIn(S)} implementation. In it, the {@code S} value represents
 * an arbitrary object serving as a source for the value.
