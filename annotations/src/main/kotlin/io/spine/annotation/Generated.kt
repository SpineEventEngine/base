/**
 * The `Generated` annotation is used to mark source code that has been generated.
 *
 * When applied to a type, it means the whole type was generated.
 * It can be also applied to an element of Java or Kotlin code to differentiate
 * generated code from handcrafted.
 *
 * The [value] element must contain the name of the generator.
 * The recommended convention is to use the fully qualified name of
 * the corresponding component, such as a class.
 * Alternatively, consider using Maven coordinates of the "generator".
 *
 * The [timestamp], which is optional, is the time when the code was generated.
 * It should follow the ISO 8601 standard.
 *
 * The [comments] element is the place for comments authors of code generators
 * may want to leave about the generated code.
 *
 * ### About the name
 *
 * The name of this annotation type must be `Generated` so that development tools
 * exclude the generated code from test coverage.
 *
 * [JaCoCo analyzes](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/issues/685#issuecomment-392020612)
 * Java classes for the presence of an annotation which simple name is `Generated`.
 * It cannot be `GrpcGenerated` or `SpineGenerated`.
 * It could be any package, but the simple name must be `Generated`.
 * Such a class is automatically excluded from the report.
 *
 * @property value Provides the name and other optional references (e.g., the version)
 *           to the code generator.
 * @property timestamp Optional date and time when the code was generated.
 * @property comments Optional comments that the code generator may want to include.
 *
 * @see Modified
 * @since 2.0.0
