/**
 * The `Modified` annotation is used to mark the source code which was
 * [created][Generated] by one code generator and then
 * modified by another code generator hereby referenced as "modifier".
 *
 * The [value] element must contain the name of the modifier.
 * The recommended convention is to use the fully qualified name of
 * the corresponding component, such as a class.
 * Alternatively, consider using Maven coordinates of the "modifier".
 *
 * The [timestamp], which is optional, is the time when the code was modified.
 * It should follow the ISO 8601 standard.
 *
 * The [comments] element is the place for comments authors of code modifiers
 * may want to leave about the modifications made to the code.
 *
 * If changes that a modifier applies to original source files are significant and
 * are likely to overwhelm the value of the [comments] element,
 * authors of modifiers may consider putting a URL to the documentation which outlines
 * the nature of changes applied by the modifier.
 *
 * @property value Provides the name and other optional references
 *           (e.g., the version) to the code generator.
 * @property timestamp Optional date and time when the code was modified.
 * @property comments Optional comments about the nature of the modification
 *           made to the original code.
 *
 * @see Generated
 * @since 2.0.0
