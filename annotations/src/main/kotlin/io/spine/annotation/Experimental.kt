/**
 * Indicates a public API that can change at any time and has no guarantee of API stability and
 * backward-compatibility.
 *
 * Here are the usage guidelines for this annotation:
 * 1. use only on public API. Internal interfaces should not use it.
 * 2. should be added only to new APIs. Adding it to an existing API is considered API-breaking.
 * 3. removing this annotation from an API gives it a stable status.
 *
 * @property value Context information such as links to discussion thread, tracking issue, etc.
