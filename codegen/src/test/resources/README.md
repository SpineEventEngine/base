Descriptor set files in this resource directory are copied from the build directory
of the `base` module for the purpose of tests of classes work with `Descriptor`s or
`DescriptorProto`s.

The content of the `main.desc` and `test.desc` is identical. 
The `test.desc` is provided only for testing of classes that deal with this file 
in relation of code generation or testing.
