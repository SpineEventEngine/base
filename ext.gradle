 * The versions of the libraries used.
 *
 * This file is used in both module `build.gradle` scripts and in the integration tests,
 * as we want to manage the versions in a single source.
 *
 * How to increment the version:
 *   1) Copy the current value of `SPINE_VERSION` to `spineToolsVersion`;
 *   2) Change the value of `SPINE_VERSION` to the desired one;
 *   3) Publish the artifacts.
 *
 * This ensures that the required `model-compiler` version is already published when we try to fetch
 * it to build `base`.
