 * This script enables the new Javadoc tags in the build.
 *
 * The tags are:
 * 1. @apiNote - the additional notes and commentaries regarding the API
 * 2. @implSpec - the implementation specification
 * 3. @implNote - the commentaries and notes about the implementation
 *
 * It also explicitly states the encoding of the source files from which the Javadoc is composed,
 * ensuring correct execution of the `javadoc` task.
 *
 * For the detailed description of the new tags, see:
 * https://blog.codefx.org/java/new-javadoc-tags/#apiNote-implSpec-and-implNote
 *
 * This script should be applied to the `subprojects` section of the root project,
 * or to the specific child projects.
