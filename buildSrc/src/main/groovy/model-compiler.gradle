/*
 * This script configures Spine defaults for the Model Compiler code generation.
 *
 * Applies the following interfaces generation configurations:
 * — all messages in Protobuf files ending with "commands.proto" are marked as `CommandMessage`;
 * — all messages in Protobuf files ending with "events.proto" are marked as `EventMessage`;
 * — all messages in Protobuf files ending with "rejections.proto" are marked as `RejectionMessage`;
 * — all messages that qualify to be UUID messages are marked as `UuidValue`;
 * — all messages that represent an entity state are marked as `EntityState`.
 *
 * And the following method generations are applied:
 * — all messages that qualify to be UUID messages have helper `generate` and `of` methods
 *   generated using `UuidMethodFactory`;
 *
 * The generation of messages representing an entity state are appended with
 * - entity columns for the fields marked as `column`;
 * - entity query and entity query builder DSL.
 *
 * The fields of the messages are marked with certain interfaces:
 * - `io.spine.base.EventMessageField` set to those in `*events.proto` and `*rejections.proto`;
 * - `io.spine.query.EntityStateField` set to the fields of messages representing an entity state.
 *
 *
 * Be aware that the root project `buildscript` should already have a classpath
 * `io.spine.tools:spine-mc-java:<version>` classpath dependency.
