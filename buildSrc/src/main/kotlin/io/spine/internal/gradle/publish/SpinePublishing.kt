/**
 * Configures [SpinePublishing] extension.
 *
 * This extension sets up publishing of JAR artifacts to Maven repositories.
 *
 * The extension can be configured for single- and multi-module projects.
 *
 * When used with a multi-module project, the extension should be opened in a root project.
 * The published modules are specified explicitly by their names:
 *
 * ```
 * spinePublishing {
 *     modules = setOf(
 *         "subprojectA",
 *         "subprojectB",
 *     )
 *     destinations = spineRepositories {
 *         setOf(
 *             cloudRepo,
 *             cloudArtifactRegistry,
 *         )
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When used with a single-module project, only destinations should be specified:
 *
 * ```
 * spinePublishing {
 *     destinations = spineRepositories {
 *         setOf(
 *             cloudRepo,
 *             cloudArtifactRegistry,
 *             gitHub("base"),
 *         )
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * It is worth to mention, that publishing of a module can be configured only from a single place.
 * For example, declaring `subprojectA` as published in a root project and opening
 * `spinePublishing` extension within `subprojectA` itself would lead to an exception.
 *
 * Along with the compilation output of `main` source set, the extension sets up publishing
 * of the next artifacts:
 *
 * 1. [MavenArtifacts.sourcesJar] – sources from `main` source set. Includes "hand-made" Java,
 *    Kotlin and Proto files. In order to include the generated code into this artifact, a module
 *    should specify those files as a part of `main` source set.
 *
 *    Here's an example of how to do that:
 *
 *    ```
 *    sourceSets {
 *        val generatedDir by extra("$projectDir/generated")
 *        val generatedSpineDir by extra("$generatedDir/main/java")
 *        main {
 *            java.srcDir(generatedSpineDir)
 *        }
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 * 2. [MavenArtifacts.testOutputJar] – compilation output of `test` source set.
 * 3. [MavenArtifacts.javadocJar] - javadoc, generated upon Java sources from `main` source set.
 *    If javadoc for Kotlin is also needed, apply Dokka plugin. It tunes `javadoc` task to generate
 *    docs upon Kotlin sources as well.
 * 4. [MavenArtifacts.protoJar] – only Proto sources from `main` source set. It's published only if
 *    Proto files are actually present in the source set. Publication of this artifact is optional,
 *    and can be disabled.
 *
 *    Here's an example of how to disable it for some of published modules:
 *
 *    ```
 *    spinePublishing {
 *        modules = setOf(
 *            "subprojectA",
 *            "subprojectB",
 *        )
 *        protoJar {
 *            exclusions = setOf(
 *                "subprojectB",
 *            )
 *        }
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 *    For all modules, or when the extension is configured within a published module itself:
 *
 *    ```
 *    spinePublishing {
 *        protoJar {
 *            disabled = true
 *        }
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 *    The resulting artifact is available under "proto" classifier. I.e., in Gradle 7+, one could
 *    depend on it like this:
 *
 *     ```
 *     implementation("io.spine:spine-client:$version@proto")
 *     ```
 *
 * To publish more artifacts for a certain project, add them to the `archives` configuration:
 *
 * ```
 * artifacts {
 *     archives(myCustomJarTask)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If any plugins applied to the published module declare any other artifacts, those artifacts
 * are published as well.
