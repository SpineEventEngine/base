            We do not apply CoreJvm Compiler Gradle plugin which adds
            the `implementation` dependency on Validation runtime automatically 
            (see `Project.configureValidation()` function in `CompilerConfigPlugin.kt`).
            
            In a test module we use vanilla `protoc` (via ProtoTap) and then run codegen
            using the Spine Compiler `Pipeline` and the plugins of the module under the test.

            Because of this we need to add the dependencies above explicitly for the
            generated code of test fixtures to compile.
