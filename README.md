# Spine Event Engine Base

This repository contains the foundation of the Spine framework which includes the following modules:

* **[`base`](base)** â€” the framework base data types and utilities for working with them.
* **[`testlib`](testlib)** - utilities for testing.

These components are used by [core-java](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/core-java) and other
Spine libraries. 

They are not supposed to be used directly by the end user project.

## Java Support

Starting version `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.78`, the modules in this repository are built with Java 11.

Prior versions, including all `1.x` versions were assembled with Java 8.
