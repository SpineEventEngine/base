# Spine Event Engine Base

This repository contains the code of foundation of the Spine Event Engine framework which includes:

* The framework [base](base) data types and utilities.
* [Utilities for testing](testlib).
* Gradle plug-ins:
  * [Spine Model Compiler](tools/model-compiler) — transforms a domain model defined in proto files 
    into the Java code.
  * [Spine Javadoc Prettifier](tools/javadoc-prettifier) — processes Javadocs of generated files.
* [Protoc plugin](tools/protoc-plugin) — a plug-in for Google Protobuf compiler for generating 
  custom code for framework-specific message types.
* [Proto JS plugin](tools/proto-js-plugin) — a plug-in that assists Protobuf JS compiler in 
  JavaScript code generation.
* [Spine Javadoc Filter](tools/javadoc-filter) — excludes elements annotated with 
  `io.spine.Internal` from the generated doc.
* [Spine Error Prone Checks](tools/errorprone-checks) — the custom Error Prone checks for the
  Spine projects.

These components are used by [core-java](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/core-java) and are not
supposed to be used directly by the end user project.

The repository also contains:

* Validating Builders [assembler](base-validating-builders) for `base`.
* A [common base](tools/plugin-base) for Spine Gradle plugins.
* [Test utilities](tools/plugin-testlib) for Spine plugins.
* [Integration tests](tools/smoke-tests) for all Spine tools.

### On Coverage

Currently the coverage stats reflect the hits gathered from unit tests. 

However, Gradle plugins, that are a significant part of this repository, are covered with integration tests. During each of those a standalone Gradle process is launched. The limitations of `jacoco` task API do not allow to include the coverage of such tests into the repository coverage report easily. 

Therefore the current coverage percentage shown is significantly lower than a real one.
